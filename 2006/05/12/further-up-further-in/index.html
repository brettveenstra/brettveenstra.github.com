          <section class="content"><p>So, having had worked at a great product development company for the past 4 1/2 years in <span class="caps">VB6</span> and only getting to dabble in .NET when I could talk them into it, I’ve <span class="more"></span>finally been blessed with a job that is aligned with my desires in&nbsp;.<span class="caps">NET</span>!</p>
<p>While I’ve built a handful of solutions, both webform and winform since 2001, they have all been in <span class="caps">VB</span>.NET. I’m going to try and push cold turkey and just switch to C#.&nbsp;Why?</p>
<p>Here’s what I can come up&nbsp;with:</p>
<ol>
<li>C# is “closer” to the .<span class="caps">NET</span> Framework - much of .NET framework was in C# and the whole experience is cleaner. I’m a control freak is the bottom&nbsp;line.</li>
<li>C# is closer to Javascript - I’m planning on web programming, and jumping in and out of brackets and the like is just something I’m feeling too lazy&nbsp;for</li>
<li>C# has huge momentum in the Software Engineering community - having <span class="caps">MORE</span> resources by industry experts, not just in the Microsoft camp is how I’d like to build software. Also, it seems that more open source projects run in the C# space than VB.NET (purely&nbsp;subjective).</li>
<li>C# in Visual Studio 2k3 has better architect tools (i.e. code comments). Yes I know about the <span class="caps">VB</span>.NET&nbsp;add-in.</li>
<li>Easier to share, debate - <span class="caps">VB</span>.NET still has a hobbyist aura. I’m anything but a hobbyist, but I grow tired of spending time on qualifications when discussing&nbsp;ideas.</li>
<li>C# to <span class="caps">VB</span>.NET conversion is actually easier to me. Sure, I could read C# and convert to VB.NET. VB.NET does some things during compile time anyway that is more declarative (see #1) and I just don’t want any more tools that hide that&nbsp;stuff.</li>
<li>Intellisense wins every time. Since I’m in Visual Studio .<span class="caps">NET</span>, it’s not like I’ll have “extra” typing to do.
Here we&nbsp;go!</li>
</ol>
<p>I promise not to become a <strong>C# biggot</strong>.</p>
